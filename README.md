## Description

This project is dependent on inquirer and uses version 8.2.4. This project is also completely intended for Node.js use. I learned about using sites to create links and badges. Also what other devs were using to create their badges and links. I was also exposed to more APIs and how to better use URLs for generating content.

## Installation

After cloning, running `npm i` within the terminal should install the dependencies needed.

## Usage

Once the dependencies have been downloaded, running `node Develop/index.js` or navigating to the Develop folder itself and running `node index.js` will run the application. Within your terminal a series of questions will generate to better create your new professional README. After answering all questions, a new README.md file will be created in the folder you are working in. Further editing can be done after creating the initial generated README.
